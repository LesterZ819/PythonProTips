#Not all code is in the Python distribution. 
#Thousands of packages are available, with common being Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn. 
#You can download packages indivdually or download a platform with multiple packages such as Anaconda. 

#when using the package you can begin by importing the entire package and then calling on the methods you need like so: 
import numpy 
numpy.array([1,2,3]) 

#you can import the package with a commonly used shorthand 
import numpy as np 
np.array([1,2,3]) 

#or import specific methods of a function 
from numpy import array 
array([1,2,3])
