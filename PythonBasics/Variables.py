#Variable Assignment uses "="
#Where comparisons uses "=="

#Variables are specific case-sensitive names 
variable = number or value 

#Below height and weight are examples of variables 
height = 64
weight = 125 

#Variables can be reassigned as often as necessary 
height = 65 
weight = 135

#Example, To calculate BMI using variables and assign it to a new variable bmi 
bmi = weight / height ** 2 

type(height)
type(bmi)
