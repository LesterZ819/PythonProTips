## Types of Models 

#### Before you can begin to create models you need to understand what models are available and which work best for which problems. There have been many books written on the subject, and at somepoint I should probably add my notes to reference later. For now the best quick explination is the visual below.

In addition to my Github notes below are book & online course recommendations for the various models. 

## Supervised Learning 
### Linear Networks (Most Common) 
### Decision Tress 
### Neural Networks (Excluding Linear) 
#### Recurrent Neural Networks 
#### Conditional Neural Networks 
#### Dense Neural Networks 
### Suport Vector Machines 

## Unsupervised Learning 
### Clustering 
#### K-Means Clustering (Most Common) 
#### Density Based Special Clustering with Noise (DBSCAN) 
### Dimensionality Reduction 
#### Principal Component Analysis (PCA) 
### Associate Rule Learning
