#Linear Regression Plots - a stright line through a scatter plot 
#Residual Plots - how much the data misses the regression line 
#Strip Plots - draws values on a number line to visualize samples of a single variable 
#Swarm Plots - Automatically shows points representing repeated values 
#Box Plots - Ilstrations of datasets including, min max, median values along with the 1st and 3rd quartiler and outliers. 
#Violin Plots -- Similar to box plots, but show curved distributions.
