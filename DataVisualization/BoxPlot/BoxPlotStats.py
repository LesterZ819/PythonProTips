#Box plots visually show stats on a dataset 

"""The box itself is bewteen the upper line, or 75th percentile, and the lower line of the 25th percentile. 
The median or 50th percentile is drawn in the middle. 
Outside the box, a line extends to the extent of the data, or to 1.5 Interquartile range (IQR) 
The IQR is calculated with 1 IQR equal to the distance bewteen the 25th and 75th percentiles. 
Any outliers, above the 1.5 IQR range are plotted as indivdual dots."""

#Use seaborn to create a boxplot.
