#Also known as network capacity 

#Overfitting is the ability to fit oddities or outliers in your data 
#overfitting makes accurate predictions on training data but inaccurate predictions on validation and new data sets 

#underfitting is when your model fails to find important predicitive patterns 
#underfitting is inaccurate in both the training data and validation data 

#validation score is the measure of a models predicitive quality 

#model capacity is the ability to capture predicitive patterns in data 

#adding node/neruons increases the model capacity 
#adding layers increases the model capcity 

#Workflow
#A. Start with a small network 
#B. Get the validation score 
#C. Keep increasing capacity until the validation score is no longer improving
