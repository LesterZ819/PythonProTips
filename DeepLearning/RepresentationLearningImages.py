#In Deep Learning, also called Representation Learning, a modeler dosen't need to specify interactions. 
#Deep networks internally build representations of patterns in the data 
#subsequent layers build increasingly sophicated representations of raw data 

#Applied to images: 
#the first node in a hidden layer may be looking for lines, 
#the second node for diganl lines, 
#later hidden layers identify larger patterns such as boxes 
#eventually the neural network is able to classifiy what the image is 

#Modeler doesn't need to specify the interactions 
#When you train the model the neural network gets weights that find the relevant patterns to make better predictions
