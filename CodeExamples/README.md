## Code Examples 

#### Examples are organized into two categories: 

1. **Analysis:**
2. **Programs:**

#### The main distinguishing difference is that programs require inputs from users. Where analysis can be done independently once connected to a data source. 
#### A great example of the difference between the two is Calculating BMI. 
#### The program is written for users to input a single person's weight and height. Then the program outputs the BMI for that person. 
#### The analysis takes a BMI datafile and preforms mathmatical analysis on the dataset. 
#### A program can have analytical components. In the BMI example this could be printing a chart showing a user where their BMI stands compared to the average person or healthy range.
