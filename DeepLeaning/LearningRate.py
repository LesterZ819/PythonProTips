#Learning Rate 
#If the slope is positve, then going opposite the slope means moving to lower numbers
#Could Subtract the slope from the current value but we don't take too big of a step 
#Instead we multiply the slope by a small number called a learning rate 
#Change the weight by the product of that multiplication 
#Weight - (LearningRate * Slope)
#Standard Learning Rate is 0.01
