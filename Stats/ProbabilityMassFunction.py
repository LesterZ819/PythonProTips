"""Probablitity Mass Function 
The set of probabilities of discrete outcomes 

The discrete Uniform PMF 
Example, a person rolling a die once. 
the outcomes are discrete because only cetain values can be obtained (1 to 6) 
Each result has the same probability of 1/6 

The PMF is a property of a probability distribution. 
A probability distribution is a mathematical description of outcomes."""
